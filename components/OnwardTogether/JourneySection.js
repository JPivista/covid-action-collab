        COVIDActionCollabâ€™s journey started with one of the most devastating public health emergencies the world has ever seen. In order to address a formidable challenge, we needed a coordinated response with partners such as USAID and the Skoll Foundation while at the heart of our initiative were people from some of the most marginalised communities. Onward Together, is a retrospective look at our journey with incredible individuals and communities, who demonstrated immense fortitude and resilience during these extraordinary times.

        Our attempt is to stand in solidarity with them and offer support in every possible way. Vaccination programs, livelihood rebuilding opportunities, early warning systems and agile healthcare facilities were a few initiatives, through which we tried to safeguard interests of the vulnerable. The stories of struggle and strength are unparalleled! It is through this presentation we hope to illustrate tales of courage, indomitable spirit and our strategic partnerships that ensured that the communities we work with are able to not only survive but thrive in the aftermath of the pandemic.
